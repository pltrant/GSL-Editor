## Build Custom VSIX File

Run the following to create a custom build of the extension:

- Update `package.json` version property to indicate pre-release build, e.g. `1.14.1-jul2025beta`
- `git clean -dxf` (Optional; prevents packaging of unnecessary files. WARNING: WILL DELETE FILES THAT AREN'T CHECKED IN!)
- `npm ci`
- `vsce package` (will run compile)

This will create a VSIX file that you can install via `Ctrl+Shift+P` -> `Extensions: Install from VSIX...` in VSCode.
